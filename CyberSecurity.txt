    Write (W): This permission level grants users the ability to create, modify, or delete files and folders.
    Execute (X): This permission level allows users to run a file or application and execute actions within it.

These permissions can be combined in different ways to form the desired access level. For example, a user may have read and write permissions for a file, allowing them to view and modify its contents, but not execute any actions within it.
Setting and Managing Permissions

Permissions can be set and managed using various tools and methods, depending on the operating system being used:

    Windows: Permissions are set through Access Control Lists (ACLs) in the security properties of a file or folder. This allows you to grant or deny specific permissions to users and groups.
    Mac: Mac uses POSIX permissions to manage access control, which can be set using the “Get Info” window for a file or folder, or through Terminal commands.
    Linux: Permissions on Linux systems are managed using the chmod command, along with the chown and chgrp commands to change the ownership of files and groups.

It’s essential to understand how these tools work and use them effectively to maintain a secure environment.
Best Practices for Implementing Permissions

To ensure cyber security with permissions, follow these best practices:

    Least Privilege Principle: Grant users the minimum level of access they need to perform their tasks. People should not have unnecessary access to sensitive information or resources.
    Regularly Review Permissions: Regularly audit permissions to ensure they are up-to-date and align with the current organizational roles and responsibilities.
    Use Groups and Roles: Group users based on their job roles and assign permissions to groups instead of individuals. This simplifies the permission management process.
    Implement Security Training: Educate users about the importance of permissions and their responsibilities to maintain a secure environment.

By understanding permissions and following best practices, you can enhance cyber security and minimize the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
