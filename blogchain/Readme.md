Can you believe that Blockchain expertise is the fastest-growing skill according to the latest skills index and is now one of the hottest in the United States job market? Did you see this technology evolution coming? Less than a decade ago very few people cared for this technology which has now become a significant career opportunity for professionals.

The demand for people with Blockchain skills is high. Due to its many fields of application, it is looking to hire those who have the skills set to navigate this new technology. Of course, just like with any other fantastic job opportunities, not everyone is cut out for these opportunities. You must have or acquire the skills that set you apart and make an employer want to entrust you with their investment.
Who is hiring

First of all, let’s explore who these potential employers are. There are four significant players in the crypto job market, these are:

    Industries – these are big companies like banks, accountancy firms, oil & gas, insurance, retailer as well as law offices that want to keep up with the technology.
    Startups – these are independent businesses and products created since the invention of Blockchain.
    Tech firms – these are the companies that have the most to lose in case Blockchain tech takes over the world. As they try to shift to a decentralized system, they need all the expertise they can gather.
    Governments –  many governments have been hiring crypto experts to advise them. Several governments are warming up to Blockchain due to its many advantages; Blockchain professionals are in high demand.

# Career Opportunities in Blockchain

You are probably wondering what these jobs and careers are and if they are available, let me answer that as walk with me. Here are some of those positions:
Blockchain developer

Blockchain developers with the expertise to help companies explore Blockchain platforms are in high demand. Blockchain development might be the most marketable career path today because people are eager to realize all the benefits of Blockchain. These individuals require absolute attention to detail as theirs is a high ranking position. Blockchain developers are programmers who create applications for blockchain. They typically have a lot of experience working with C++, Python, and Javascript before becoming Blockchain developers.
Blockchain Solution Architect

The Blockchain Solution Architect has the responsibility of designing, assigning, and connecting Blockchain solution components with the team experts such as developers, network administrators, UX designers, and IT Operations whose to develop to complete the Blockchain solutions.
Blockchain project manager

This individual is entrusted with the responsibility of connecting Blockchain projects to experts whose duty it is to develop Blockchain solutions. Blockchain project managers need to be equipped with the skills of a traditional (cloud) project manager. They also need to master the technical bit to understand the technology thoroughly. Another important ability is excellent communication skills; this is essential when addressing non-technical workers, when providing useful updates or when trying to get resources from higher authorities.
Blockchain UX designer

With the incorporation of Blockchain into so many industries, its design as well as user interface, is becoming critical. The role of a Blockchain designer is shaping a user interface that creates trust and is alluring to a regular user. These individuals need to be able to pay attention to detail, have an artistic touch, but most importantly they need to be hardworking as their line of work requires them to spend countless hours behind their computers.
Blockchain quality engineer

In any development environment, we have a quality assurance engineer who tests and ensures that all areas of the project are of the required quality. In the Blockchain world, a Blockchain engineer plays a similar role by guaranteeing that all operations are of excellence in the Blockchain development environment. In other words, they conduct the testing and automation of frameworks for Blockchain. These individuals need to have a third eye as far as payment to detail is concerned because a small mistake on their part affects everyone using their technology. Excellent communication skills would also go a long way in maintaining good work relationships.
Blockchain legal consultant

Of course, as organizations try to comprehend the adoption of Blockchain into their systems legal issues always arise. As companies launch this new technology, they are also looking for legal expertise on what considerations to make while investing. They are curious about the implications of their actions, about how to handle their finances, and lastly how to manage their identity. Of course, for such an individual, proper communication skills are mandatory. You also need to have a good grasp of your international law as Blockchain is tech without borders for the same reason it is advisable that such people master as many universal languages as they can.
Everyone in the business

Besides the specific roles of professionals working with Blockchain technologies, it is also important that everyone in the organization has a fundamental organization of the Blockchain. Only when everyone has an understanding of the benefits, key capabilities, use cases, and critical success factors, organizations can fully exploit the Blockchain.
Other connected roles

If you want to be successful in a crypto career, do the following:

    Get certified
    Keep up to date with industry trends
    Be flexible; these careers come in many forms
    Love crypto and blockchain (I feel like that one goes without saying).

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and oftentimes public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.

# Blockchain Structure

The blockchain gets its name from its underlying structure. The blockchain is organized as a series of “blocks” that are “chained” together.

Understanding blockchain security requires understanding how the blockchain is put together. This requires knowing what the blocks and chains of blockchain are and why they are designed the way that they are.

Application and uses of Blockchain technology

Blockchain applications go far beyond cryptocurrency and bitcoin. With its ability to create more transparency and fairness while also saving businesses time and money, the technology is impacting a variety of sectors in ways that range from how contracts are enforced to making government work more efficiently.

# Decentralization

In blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network. Decentralized networks strive to reduce the level of trust that participants must place in one another, and deter their ability to exert authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the functionality of the network.

Why it matters

The nature of blockchain allows for trustless systems to be built on top of it. Users don’t rely on a centralized group of people, such as a bank, to make decisions and allow transactions to flow through. Because the system is decentralized, users know that transactions will never be denied for non-custodial reasons.

This decentralization enables use-cases that were previously impossible, such as parametric insurance, decentralized finance, and decentralized organizations (DAOs), among a few. This allows developers to build products that provide immediate value without having to go through a bureaucratic process of applications, approvals, and general red tape.

# Decentralization vs trust

Blockchains, cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and oracles have emerged as new technologies for coordinating social and economic activities in a more secure, transparent, and accessible manner. Most importantly, these technologies are revealing the power of cryptographic guarantees—what we often call cryptographic truth—in restoring users’ trust in everyday interactions.

# Blockchain Oracles

A blockchain oracle is a third-party service that connects smart contracts with the outside world, primarily to feed information in from the world, but also the reverse. Information from the world encapsulates multiple sources so that decentralized knowledge is obtained.

Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement.

# Solidity

Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by Ethereum Network team for constructing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.

    It’s used to create smart contracts that implements business logic and generate a chain of transaction records in the blockchain system.
    It acts as a tool for creating machine-level code and compiling it on the Ethereum Vitural Machine (EVM).

# Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language. Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It is popular on smart contract chains Solana and Polkadot.

# Crypto Wallets

A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, physical medium, program, or service which stores the public and/or private keys for cryptocurrency transactions. In addition to this basic function of storing the keys, a cryptocurrency wallet more often also offers the functionality of encrypting and/or signing information.

# Decentralized Storage

Decentralized storage is where data is stored on a decentralized network across multiple locations by users or groups who are incentivized to join, store, and keep data accessible. The servers used are hosted by people, rather than a single company. Anyone is free to join, they are kept honest due to smart contracts, and they are incentivized to participate via tokens.

# Version Control Systems

Version control/source control systems allow developers to track and control changes to code over time. These services often include the ability to make atomic revisions to code, branch/fork off of specific points, and to compare versions of code. They are useful in determining the who, what, when, and why code changes were made.

# State and Payment Channels

State channels refer to the process in which users transact with one another directly outside of the blockchain, or ‘off-chain,’ and greatly minimize their use of ‘on-chain’ operations.

# Ethereum 2

Ethereum 2.0 marks a long-anticipated upgrade to the Ethereum public mainnet. Designed to accelerate Ethereum’s usage and adoption by improving its performance, Ethereum 2.0 implements Proof of Stake.

# Supporting Languages

While the bulk of the logic in blockchain applications is handled by smart contracts, all the surrounding services that support those smart contracts (frontend, monitoring, etc.) are often written in other languages.
### Javascript
##### supporting languages

JavaScript

JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It lets us add interactivity to pages e.g. you might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, and popups etc on different websites — all of that is built using JavaScript. Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications and so on.
